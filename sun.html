                    <h2>Age</h2>
                    <p>The sun was born about 4.6 billion years ago. Many scientists think the sun and the rest of the
                        solar system formed from a giant, rotating cloud of gas and dust known as the solar nebula. As
                        the nebula collapsed because of its gravity, it spun faster and flattened into a disk. Most of
                        the material was pulled toward the center to form the sun. The sun has enough nuclear fuel to
                        stay much as it is now for another 5 billion years. After that, it will swell to become a red
                        giant. Eventually, it will shed its outer layers, and the remaining core will collapse to become
                        a white dwarf. </p>
                    <h2>Size</h2>
                    <p>The sun lies at the heart of the solar system, where it is by far the largest object. It holds
                        99.8 percent of the solar system's mass and is roughly 109 times the diameter of the Earth â€”
                        about one million Earths could fit inside the sun.It may be the biggest thing in this neighborhood, 
                        but the sun is just average compared to other stars. Betelgeuse, a red giant, is about 700 times bigger
                        than the sun and about 14,000 times brighter. According to NASA's solar scientist C. Alex Young, if 
                        the sun were hollow, it would take about one million Earths to fill it. </p>
                    <h2>Temperature</h2>
                    <p>The visible part of the sun is about 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit (5,500 degrees Celsius), while
                        temperatures in the core reach more than 27 million F (15 million C), driven by nuclear
                        reactions. One would need to explode 100 billion tons of dynamite every second to match the
                        energy produced by the sun, according to NASA.</p>

                    <h3>Fun Fact #1</h3>
                    <p>Did you know that one million Earths could fit inside the sun?</p>
                    <h3>Fun Fact #2</h3>
                    <p>The sun contains 99.86% of the mass in the Solar System, which is almost 330,000 times greater
                        than that of Earth!</p>
                    <h3>Fun Fact #3</h3>
                    <p>Despite the sun is 330,00 times greater than Earth, in approximately 130 million years the sun
                        will be the same size as Earth!</p>
                    <h3>Fun Fact #4</h3>
                    <p>The distance from the sun to Earth changes throughout the year, it varies between 147-152 million
                        kilometres</p>
                    <h3>Fun Fact #5</h3>
                    <p>Light from the sun takes 8 minutes to reach Earth, light travels 300,000 kilometres per second</p>
                    <h3>Fun Fact #6</h3>
                    <p>The sun travels at a very high speed, approximately 220km per second</p>
