                    <h2 >Age</h2>
                    <p>The moon is very old. A new analysis of lunar rocks brought to Earth by Apollo astronauts suggests that the 
                        moon formed 4.51 billion years ago â€” just 60 million years after the solar system itself took shape. Some 
                        previous studies have come up with similar estimates, while others have argued for a younger moon that 
                        coalesced 150 million to 200 million years after the solar system was born. The new finding, which was 
                        published today (Jan. 11) in the journal Science Advances, should settle this long-standing debate, team 
                        members said.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Size</h2>
                    <p>Earth's moon is the brightest object in our night sky. It appears quite large, but that is only because it  
                        is the closest celestial body. The moon is a bit more than one-fourth (27 percent) the size of Earth, a 
                        much smaller ratio (1:4) than any other planets and their moons. Earth's moon is the fifth largest moon 
                        in the solar system. The moon's mean radius is 1,079.6 miles (1,737.5 kilometers). Double those figures 
                        to get its diameter: 2,159.2 miles (3,475 km), less than a third the width of Earth. The moon's equatorial 
                        circumference is 6,783.5 miles (10,917 km). "If Earth were the size of a nickel, the moon would be about 
                        as big as a coffee bean," according to NASA.
                    </p>
                    <h2 >Temperature</h2>
                    <p>The moon rotates on its axis in about 27 days. Daytime on one side of the moon lasts about 13 and a half 
                        days, followed by 13 and a half nights of darkness. When sunlight hits the moon's surface, the temperature 
                        can reach 260 degrees Fahrenheit

                    <h3>Fun Fact #1</h3>
                    <p>Scientists believe that the moon was created from the accumulation of debri after a collision between Earth 
                        and a Mars-sized body 4.5 billion years ago
                    </p>
                    <h3>Fun Fact #2</h3>
                    <p>You could fit 49 Moons inside of the Earth</p>
                    <h3>Fun Fact #3</h3> 
                    <P>It would take you 19 years to walk to the Moon and back</p>
                    <h3>Fun Fact #4</h3> 
                    <p>The moons surface has many mountains, huge craters and wide planes of hardened lava</p>
                    <h3>Fun Fact #5</h3> 
                    <p>Despite that the moon can be very bright at night, it doesn't actually produce its own light; instead it reflects from the Sun </p>
                    <h3>Fun Fact #6</h3> 
                    <p>The moons gravity is much weaker than Earths, its only 1/6 of Earth's! That means you'd weigh less if you stood on the moon</p>
